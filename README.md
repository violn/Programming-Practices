# Programming-Practices
A collection of code of different languages I'm currently trying to learn.

##C-Sharp
The programming lanaguage I'm most familiar with due to me modding some games with it although I'm still pretty bad at it.

##Java
The first OOP langauge I've and the one that really got me into programming and I'm starting to relearn in preperation for a college I'm goign to take.

##C++
The first language I learned on my own time for non school related things. I only used this language to as practice so I can easily transfer to C#.

##Python
I only learned this because it was pretty popular although I don't use it personally because I'm not a real huge fan of the syntax.
